    In problem 4 I decided to just make an additional function to add on to problem 1. This allowed me to worry less aboiut how it will be implimented and more about checking for the edge. 

    Other than that I had to make sure the function covered multiple different cases such as finding the edge, not finding the edge, or having out of bounds information passed to the function. After sorting out those cases it was really just choosing how i wanted my loop to work and because there was no guarentee to how many time it would take to find the edge I went with a while loop.

    The utility of this program comes from learning how to implement additonal functions to a prestablished program. While this program is still very simple it does work through the process of checking how different stucts work and making sure that edges are able to be found after they are added. Additionally this is useful for checkiing memberhip within preestablished functions. This makes other functions do less work overall because if it does not exist then work might not need to be done.

    In different contexts this can be useful in networking as well. Similar to what I talked about before checking to see if a link exists or is on can be good to have on hand in a easily accessable way. If the program were expanded upon then it could cover different cases such as adding an edge if it is not seen or providing the user with additional information about the edge once it is found. Having the bare bones of this function allows for its use cases to be transformed in to many different situations. This allows for it to have a more dynamic applicaiton as opposed to being used for one hyperspecific case.
